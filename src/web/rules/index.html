              <p>Every game needs rules.  Rules lay out the methods, boundaries, and parameters that keep the game play consistent and reasonably fair.  Who creates the rules?  The game designer.  Stories also have rules.  Those rules, as determined by the story maker, keeps the story's world and characters that interact with that world behaving consistently.</p>

              <p>One or more players <i>play</i> a game by performing actions that are within the defined game rules.  For example, <i>Go</i> and <i>Chess</i>.  Stories, on the other hand, take the audience on an emotional ride through a narrative.  Unlike games, most stories do not involve direct audience participation.</p>

              <p>Role-playing games are like two rivers joining at a confluence; a convergence of stories and games.  The two branches, stories and games, mix into each other forming a thing that takes the players on an emotional joyride through a story that they help shape and form.  Just like improvisational actors, the players play the unscripted role of one or more character.</p>

              <p>How does a story move along in a role-playing game?  A player who is familiar with the rules and has a story in mind chooses to be the game's storyteller and referee rolled all into one keeps the story flowing.  They are typically called a Game Master.</p>

              <p>Some role-playing games lean more towards the gaming aspect and the story aspect just adds flavor.  Other role-playing games lean more towards the story aspect.</p>

              <p>Cavea is a role-playing game that strives to find a comfortable place somewhere in the middle.  This book, <i>Cavea: <small>Rules of the Stage</small></i>, covers only the rules of the game.  Other books will mix in the story flavors.</p>

                <p>Polyhedral dice are an essential part of the basic mechanics of Cavea's rules.  Cavea uses a die notation that is common amongst other role-playing games: <span class="d">dN</span> where <i>d</i> means a single die with <i>N</i> number of sides.</p>

                <p>How many of each type of die are needed?  Two of each at the very minimum. To keep the die rolling from slowing down game play, four or more of each die type is recommended for a player and six or more of each die type is recommended for a game master.  A dice cup is also recommended, especially when the level pools get large and also when playing with kids.</p>

              <p>Players play the roles of the lead characters of a game's story.  They are the stars of the story.  They bring the protagonists to imaginary life.</p>

The counts of multiple die types are separated by a <i>|</i>. If there is a modifier to be applied, it appears at the end, also separated for the other counts by a <i>|</i>.

                        <p>Alice is the game master.  Jill is playing a character named Sally.  Sally is a rookie police officer and is nearly at the end of a long foot chase.  She has the running suspect, Bruno, right at her finger tips.</p>

                        <p>Alice decides that Jill needs a <i>1</i> or higher to successfully grab Bruno or a <i>4</i> or higher to successfully grab him and throw him to the ground.</p>

                        <p>Sally has a level pool of <code class="lp">4:d6|4:d10</code> for her <i>Wing Chun</i> skill.  Jill rolls 5, 6, 1, 1, 7, 1, 6, and 9.  Jill adds up all of the <i>1</i>s for a total of <i>3</i>.</p>

                        <p>Alice decides that Bruno is going to use his well honed street fighting skill to strike Sally.  His <i>Street Fighting</i> level pool is <code class="lp">1:d4|2:d6|4:d10</code>.  Alice rolls 1, 5, 5, 1, 5, 1, and 1.  She adds up the <i>1</i>s for a total of 4.</p>

                        <p>Jill rolls 3, 1, 5, 3, 4, 10, 8.  Only a single <i>1</i>.</p>

                        <ul class="list-unstyled">

                        <p>Alice rolls some dice and figures out where and how bad Sally was hit.</p>

                        <ul class="list-unstyled">
                          <li><b>Alice:</b> "Bruno's fist strikes Sally hard in her left eye for twelve points of damage."</li>

                          <li><b>Alice:</b> "She'll have a swollen black eye for a week.  She will also have a minus one (-1) for her fighting skills until the swelling goes down.  A pack of ice might help."</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Jill makes a note that Sally's <i>Wing Chun</i> skill temporarily has a level pool of <code class="lp">4:d6|4:d10|-1</code>.</p>

                        <ul class="list-unstyled">

                          <li><b>Jill:</b> "Yes"</li>

                        </ul>

                        <p>Alice rolls Bruno's <i>Street Fighting</i> skill, again.  She rolls 3, 2, 6, 8, 9, 4, and 2.  No <i>1</i>s.</p>

                        <p>Jill rolls 3, 6, 5, 1, 10, 4, 7, and 2.  She adds up the <i>1</i>s subtracts 1 for the swollen eye and adds 1 for being completely on the defensive. The total result comes to 1.</p>

                  <p>The following describes how to calculate a character's health points.</p>
  
                  <ol>
                    <li>Find the <i>Level Pool Die to Health Points</i> table that is appropriate for the character's species, race, culture, and age.</li>
                    <li>For each die in the character's <i>mSt</i>, <i>mEn</i>, <i>mAg</i>, <i>bSt</i>, <i>bEn</i>, and <i>bAg</i> attribute level pools:
                      <ol>
                        <li>Look up the Health Point value for the type of die in the table, and</li>
                        <li>add the value to the character's Health Point total.</li>
                      </ol>
                    </li>

                <p>A disability can also be rated as <i>minor</i>, but it does not impair the character.  A minor disability, as it pertains to the game, is considered to be character flavoring.</p>
                
                <p>Disabilities and Health Points are separate.  A character can be disabled and healthy.</p>

An adventurer falls into a spiked pit, gets chewed on by pirañas, eats an under cooked chicken leg from a road side vendor, or gets blasted by the acid spray of a gorganuan marsh dragon.</p>
