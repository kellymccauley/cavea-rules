              <p>Every game needs rules.  Rules lay out the methods, boundaries, and parameters that keep the game play consistent and reasonably fair.  Who creates the rules?  The game designer.  Stories also have rules.  Those rules, as determined by the story maker, keeps the story's world and characters that interact with that world behaving consistently.</p>

              <p>One or more players <i>play</i> a game by performing actions that are within the defined game rules.  For example, <i>Go</i> and <i>Chess</i>.  Stories, on the other hand, take the audience on an emotional ride through a narrative.  Unlike games, most stories do not involve direct audience participation.</p>

              <p>Role-playing games are like two rivers joining at a confluence; a convergence of stories and games.  The two branches, stories and games, mix into each other forming a thing that takes the players on an emotional joyride through a story that they help shape and form.  Just like improvisational actors, the players play the unscripted role of one or more character.</p>

              <p>How does a story move along in a role-playing game?  A player who is familiar with the rules and has a story in mind chooses to be the game's storyteller and referee rolled all into one keeps the story flowing.  They are typically called a Game Master.</p>

              <p>Some role-playing games lean more towards the gaming aspect and the story aspect just adds flavor.  Others lean more towards the story aspect.  Cavea is a role-playing game that is striving to find a comfortable place somewhere in the middle.</p>
              
              <p>This book, <i>Cavea: <small>Rules of the Stage</small></i>, covers only the main rules of the game.  The story setting books will supply the settings, background, and setting specific rules that build upon the main rules.</p>

                <p>Polyhedral dice are an essential part of the basic mechanics of Cavea's rules.  Cavea uses a die notation that is common amongst other role-playing games: <span class="d">dN</span> where <i>d</i> means a single die with <i>N</i> number of sides.</p>

                  </div>
                </figure>

                <p>How many of each type of die are needed?  Two of each at the very minimum. To keep the die rolling from slowing down game play, four or more of each die type is recommended for a player and six or more of each die type is recommended for a game master.  A dice cup is also recommended, especially when the level pools get large and also when playing with kids.</p>

                    <p>Damage dice is the measure of the potential amount of damage than can be dealt.  The amount of damage dealt differs depending on the game's genre and style.  To represent the different damage styles, either the setting/universe book or the game master will specify the die type used for damage.  The type of damage die can be one of: <span class="d">d4</span>, <span class="d">d6</span>, <span class="d">d8</span>, or <span class="d">d10</span>.  Once chosen for a game or campaign, the type of damage die should not be changed unless the game master and all players agree to make the change.</p>

                    <p>Cavea uses the following notation to represent damage dice: <span class="d">Nd</span> where <i>N</i> is the number of dice and <i>d</i> is the damage dice chosen by the game master or specified by the </p>
