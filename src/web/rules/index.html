              <h1>Preface</h1>

              <p>Every game needs rules.  Rules lay out the methods, boundaries, and parameters that keep the game play consistent and reasonably fair.  Who creates the rules?  The game designer.  Stories also have rules.  Those rules, as determined by the story maker, keeps the story's world and characters that interact with that world behaving consistently.</p>

              <p>One or more players <i>play</i> a game by performing actions that are within the defined game rules.  For example, <i>Go</i> and <i>Chess</i>.  Stories, on the other hand, take the audience on an emotional ride through a narrative.  Unlike games, most stories do not involve direct audience participation.</p>

              <p>Role-playing games are like two rivers joining at a confluence; a convergence of stories and games.  The two branches, stories and games, mix into each other forming a thing that takes the players on an emotional joyride through a story that they help shape and form.  Just like improvisational actors, the players play the unscripted role of one or more character.</p>

              <p>How does a story move along in a role-playing game?  A player who is familiar with the rules and has a story in mind chooses to be the game's storyteller and referee rolled all into one keeps the story flowing.  They are typically called a Game Master.</p>

              <p>Some role-playing games lean more towards the gaming aspect and the story aspect just adds flavor.  Other role-playing games lean more towards the story aspect.</p>

              <p>Cavea is a role-playing game that strives to find a comfortable place somewhere in the middle.  This book, <i>Cavea: <small>Rules of the Stage</small></i>, covers only the rules of the game.  Other books will mix in the story flavors.</p>

                <h1>Dice</h1>

                <p>Polyhedral dice are an essential part of the basic mechanics of Cavea's rules.  Cavea uses a die notation that is common amongst other role-playing games: <code>dN</code> where <i>d</i> means a single die with <i>N</i> number of sides.</p>

                <p>How many of each type of die are needed?  Two of each at the very minimum. To keep the die rolling from slowing down game play, four or more of each die type is recommended for a player and six or more of each die type is recommended for a game master.  A dice cup is also recommended, especially when the level pools get large and also when playing with kids.</p>

              <p>Players play the roles of the lead characters of a game's story.  They are the stars of the story.  They bring the protagonists to imaginary life.</p>

                <p>To describe the count of one type of die in a level pool, Cavea uses a notation of <code>C:dN</code> where <i>C</i> is the count of dice with <i>N</i> number of sides.  The counts of multiple die types are separated by a <i>|</i>. If there is a modifier to be applied, it appears at the end, also separated for the other counts by a <i>|</i>.
