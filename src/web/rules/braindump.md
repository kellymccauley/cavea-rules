## Skill where a specialization _must_ be chosen

Let <i>S</i> be a skill that requires a specialization to be chosen.

* <i>S</i> is a broad categorical skill that may have very distinct and potentially unrelated knowledge bases.
* <i>S</i> does not have a level pool.
  * Advancement points cannot be spent directly on <i>S</i>.
  * <i>S</i> cannot be combined with other skills.
  * <i>S</i> cannot be enhanced by other skills.

Let <i>s<sub>1</sub></i> be a specialization of <i>S</i>.

* <i>s<sub>1</sub></i> is specific skill.
* <i>s<sub>1</sub></i> has a level pool.
  * Advancement points can be spent directly on <i>s<sub>1</sub></i>.
  * <i>s<sub>1</sub></i> may be combined with other skills.
  * <i>s<sub>1</sub></i> may be enhanced by other skills.
* <i>s<sub>1</sub></i> must not have further specializations.

Skills of this type may be candidates for splitting the specializations into separately defined general skills.


## Skill where a specialization _may_ be chosen

Let _P_ be a skill where a specialization is optional.

* _P_ is a general skill that consists of a single broad knowledge base.
* _P_ has a level pool.
  * Advancement points can be spent directly on _P_.
  * _P_ may be combined with other skills.
  * _P_ may be enhanced by other skills.
  * A specialization of _P_ enhances _P_ if the conditions of the specialization are met.

Let _p<sub>1</sub>_ be a specialization of _P_.

* _p<sub>1</sub>_ has a level pool.
  * Advancement points can be spent directly on _p<sub>1</sub>_.
* _p<sub>1</sub>_ is always combined to enhance _P_.
  * _p<sub>1</sub>_ has situation specific conditions that must apply before it may be used to enhance _P_.
